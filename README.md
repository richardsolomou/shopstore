ShopCMS
=======

This is my code for the Web-Script Programming unit coursework (year 2) that I was assessed in during my studies for a BSc (Hons) Computer Science degree at the University of Portsmouth.

Specification
-------------
This coursework assessment had us to construct a website that would support an easily updateable and customizable online shopping store for selling all kinds of physical products.

This implied that we needed to build a Content Management System (CMS) that our client could use to describe and catalogue the products that they had for sale. It was also mentionde that it should be possible to use the CMS to add new products at any time, to delete products, to record that additional stock of a product has come in, and so on.

The client's staff should be able to access pages which report what is to be sent to whom, at what addresses, and also to get management reports on stock levels (what stock items are running low? - and therefore need to be re-ordered from the suppliers?), cash taken, etc.

The website should be flexible enough that different clients can use the CMS (and nothing else) to produce websites for selling very different physical products.

Aims
----
My main aims and intentions related to the final product are listed below:
* Code validity (Valid HTML5 and Valid CSS3)
* Error-free JavaScript
* Aesthetically pleasing to use design
* Room for improvement

Restrictions
------------
There were a few things that we weren't allowed to use in this assignment:
* JavaScript Libraries (jQuery, Backbone, etc.)
* PHP Libraries (Smarty, Akismet, etc.)
* Code from tutorials (without referencing at least)
If any of the above were used on parts that were marked by the marking scheme, we would not receive any marks for those parts.
